### [Xi Jinping Thought, Facebook’s Blindspot, The Moat Map Revisited](https://stratechery.com/2020/xi-jinping-thought-facebooks-blindspot-the-moat-map-revisited/)

> First, in [China, Leverage, and Values](https://stratechery.com/2019/china-leverage-and-values/), I highlighted that China’s vision of the role of technology was fundamentally different than the West’s; in the [China Cultural Clash](https://stratechery.com/2019/the-china-cultural-clash/), I warned that China wasn’t simply interested in being different, but in exporting those differences to the West. And finally, yesterday’s [The TikTok War](https://stratechery.com/2020/the-tiktok-war/) is very much a call to action on the part of the West, rooted above all in a recognition that this isn’t simply an economic battle, but an ideological one.

> There is one other point that is important to make: it is absolutely a valid distinction that Facebook is a U.S. company and TikTok is a Chinese one. To put in the plainest possible terms, Chinese social networks censor criticism of Chairman Xi, while U.S. social networks are boycotted for declining to censor President Trump; you can go to prison for mocking Xi, and you can rocket to stardom by mocking Trump — on TikTok, no less! Make no mistake, the U.S. is deeply flawed, but the differences in government control of information and ideas are real and stark, and it is dangerously cynical to suggest otherwise.

> The key point about Communist Party ideology — the unbroken thread that runs from Lenin through Stalin, Mao and Xi — is that the party is and always has defined itself as being in perpetual struggle with the “hostile” forces of Western liberalism…

> ...he \[Xi\] has been bending the Internet from an instrument of democratization into a tool of omniscient control.
